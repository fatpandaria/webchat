## What is this
+ this is a webchat app built on webrtc(using the API of [peerjs](https://github.com/peers/peerjs)) and websocket(hosted by myself on ali cloud,it is forked from [peerjs-server](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server))
+ this project is still under working
## How to Start
+ git clone git@github.com:fatpandaria/webchat.git 
+ npm install 
+ npm start
+ without any change to the Peer() config, you will use my server as default,which helps two people to exchange information to build a webRTC PeerConnection,after that your stream will go directly to the people you have connected.

## For more information 
+ just check the original peerjs repo out;
